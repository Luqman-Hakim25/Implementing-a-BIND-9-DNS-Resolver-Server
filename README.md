# Implementing-a-BIND-9-DNS-Resolver-Server

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a secure and privacy-focused internal DNS resolver using **BIND 9** on **Debian 12**. It was designed to enhance DNS control, improve internal network efficiency, and mitigate privacy and security concerns related to third-party DNS services. By leveraging technologies such as **ACLs**, **DNSSEC**, **RPZ**, and **rate limiting**, the resolver can protect the network from unauthorized queries, DNS spoofing, and access to malicious domains.

## BIND 9

BIND 9 (Berkeley Internet Name Domain version 9) is a premier open-source DNS server software developed by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). Renowned for its robustness and flexibility, BIND 9 serves a crucial role in the DNS infrastructure, capable of acting as both an authoritative name server and a recursive resolver. It supports a comprehensive array of DNS features, including IPv6, DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), and dynamic DNS updates, ensuring enhanced security, reliability, and functionality. BIND 9 is designed to be highly scalable, making it suitable for deployment in various environments, from small networks to large enterprises and ISPs. Its vast configuration options allow administrators to fine-tune performance and security settings according to specific needs. BIND 9 also offers extensive logging and statistics, aiding in effective monitoring and troubleshooting. Furthermore, it supports modern DNS protocols and standards, ensuring compatibility with other DNS implementations.

## Features

- Recursive DNS resolution for internal clients

- DNSSEC support for query integrity

- ACL (Access Control List) to restrict query access

- RPZ (Response Policy Zone) to block phishing/malicious domains

- DNSTAP and logging for monitoring and analysis

- DNS query caching for performance optimization

- Protection against DNS spoofing

- RPZ zone automation threat updates

## Installation & Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Debian 12 (Bookworm)

- BIND 9 (`sudo apt install bind9 bind9utils bind9-doc`)

- Curl, cron, and standard CLI tools

### Installation Steps

Install BIND 9

```
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install BIND 9
sudo apt install bind9
```

Verify Installation

```
named -v
# Should output something like: BIND 9.18.x
```

### Configuration Files

- `/etc/bind/named.conf.options`

- `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`

- `/etc/bind/named.conf.logging`

- `/etc/bind/root.hints`

- RPZ zone files: `rpz.malware.db`, `rpz.phishing.db`

- Automation script: `update-rpz.sh`

Refer to the `/config` and `/scripts` folders for sample configurations.

### Configure BIND 9 as a Secure DNS Resolver

#### Configure Main BIND Files

```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf
```

```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.options
```

```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
```

#### Add Root Hints

```
sudo curl -o /etc/bind/db.root https://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache
```

Ensure it’s referenced in `/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones`.

#### ACL – Access Control List

```
acl internal-networks {
    127.0.0.1;
    192.168.1.0/24;
};
```

Only client IP Address that only belong inside this list would be allow to use this BIND 9 DNS. If want to add client, should be include the IP address here.

#### Configure Logging (Optional)

```
sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.logging
```

Create the log directory:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/named
sudo chown bind:bind /var/log/named
```

#### Configure RPZ – Response Policy Zones

Add to `/etc/bind/named.conf.options`:

```
response-policy {
    zone "rpz.malware.local";
    zone "rpz.phishing.local";
};
```

Declare Zones

In `/etc/bind/named.conf.local`:

```

```









### Automation with `cron` (update RPZ)
