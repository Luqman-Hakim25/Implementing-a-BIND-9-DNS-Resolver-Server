BIND 9 (Berkeley Internet Name Domain version 9) is a premier open-source DNS server software developed by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). Renowned for its robustness and flexibility, BIND 9 serves a crucial role in the DNS infrastructure, capable of acting as both an authoritative name server and a recursive resolver. It supports a comprehensive array of DNS features, including IPv6, DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), and dynamic DNS updates, ensuring enhanced security, reliability, and functionality. BIND 9 is designed to be highly scalable, making it suitable for deployment in various environments, from small networks to large enterprises and ISPs. Its vast configuration options allow administrators to fine-tune performance and security settings according to specific needs. BIND 9 also offers extensive logging and statistics, aiding in effective monitoring and troubleshooting. Furthermore, it supports modern DNS protocols and standards, ensuring compatibility with other DNS implementations.

## Updating RPZ Zone
RPZ zone

Automating the Process (RPZ Automation)

To automate the process of updating the RPZ zone files with data from public feeds, you can create a script that regularly downloads the feeds, formats them into the RPZ zone file format, and then reloads the BIND service. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to set this up.


Step

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Identify the Sources for RPZ Data
You will first need to find a reliable source for the RPZ data (malware and phishing domains). Some public feeds include:

Abuse.ch (Malware Domain Blocklist)
OpenPhish (Phishing URL Feed)
Blocklist.de (Malware Feed)
Zeus Tracker (Malicious Domains)

For example, we'll assume you're using Abuse.ch and OpenPhish.

MALWARE_FEED_URL="https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/downloads/hostfile/"
PHISHING_FEED_URL="https://openphish.com/feed.txt"

-->
*Note

i.Check the feed url
example:
try to search this url on browser
https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/malware_domains.txt

this url would return with errors

explaination:
The Feodo Tracker's URLs for downloading domain feeds may have changed or been deprecated. You can check the latest URLs on their official website or use alternative feeds. Let's troubleshoot and find an alternative solution for getting the malware feed.


Steps to Resolve:
Check the Feodo Tracker Website Visit the official Feodo Tracker website:
https://feodotracker.abuse.ch
Look for the "Downloads" or "Indicators" section to find the updated URLs for domain lists.

Alternative Feeds for Malware Domains If the specific Feodo Tracker feed is unavailable, you can use other trusted sources for malware domains, such as:

Malware Domain List: https://www.malwaredomainlist.com
URLhaus by Abuse.ch: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch
For example, use the URLhaus host list for malware domains:
https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/downloads/hostfile/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Install Necessary Tools
Make sure the system has the necessary tools to download and process the data. You can install curl (to fetch the data) and awk or sed (to format it):

#bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl awk sed
sudo apt install gawk
awk --version


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Create the Script to Download and Format RPZ Files
Create a script, for example /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh, that will:

i-Download the data from the feeds.
ii-Format the data into RPZ-compatible records.
iii-Write the formatted data to the RPZ zone files (rpz.malware.db and rpz.phishing.db).
iv-Reload BIND to apply the changes.


-->
-create the script file:
Refer "RPZ zone updating script"

-->
set the appropriate permissions for the script file:
Yes, you need to set the appropriate permissions for the script file /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh to ensure it can be executed securely by the system and authorized users.

Recommended Permissions
Ownership: Set the file to be owned by root (or another system administrator account):

#bash
Copy code
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh
Permissions: Allow only the owner (root) to write to the file, while other users can execute it:

#bash
Copy code
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh
7: Owner can read, write, and execute.
5: Group and others can read and execute but cannot modify.



Verify Permissions
Check the file permissions:

#bash
Copy code
sudo ls -l /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh
You should see:

sql
Copy code
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh

*Note
Explanation

Malware Feed URL:
Replaced the placeholder MALWARE_FEED_URL with the URLhaus by Abuse.ch malware domain list:
https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/downloads/hostfile/


Phishing Feed URL:
Replaced the placeholder PHISHING_FEED_URL with the OpenPhish Free Feed URL:
https://openphish.com/feed.txt

Processing Feeds:

Added a grep command to exclude comments (#) and empty lines in the feeds.
Used awk to format the domains into RPZ records with CNAME ..

The awk command formats the domains into RPZ-compatible CNAME . records.
The script updates the RPZ zone files (rpz.malware.db and rpz.phishing.db), ensures the correct file permissions, and reloads the BIND server to apply the changes.



-->
Verify Feeds
Before finalizing the script, test the URLs:

Manually Test the Feed URLs:

#bash
Copy code
curl -s https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/downloads/hostfile/
curl -s https://openphish.com/feed.txt
Ensure they return valid data. If a URL is invalid, check the respective website for updated information.


Update the RPZ Database Files: Run the script manually to confirm it generates valid RPZ records:
#bash
Copy code
sudo /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Make the Script Executable
Make sure the script is executable:

#bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Test the Script

Run the script manually to ensure it works as expected:
#bash
Copy code
sudo /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh

Verify:
The RPZ files (rpz.malware.db and rpz.phishing.db) are updated with properly formatted records.
The bind9 service reloads without errors:
#bash
sudo systemctl status bind9


Check the log file for updates:
#bash
sudo cat /var/log/rpz-update.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/rpz-update.log

To check for errors in the /etc/bind/rpz.phishing.db file, you can use the named-checkzone command, which is specifically designed to validate BIND zone files. Here's the command:

#bash
sudo named-checkzone rpz.phishing.local /etc/bind/rpz.phishing.db

Explanation:
-named-checkzone: Verifies the syntax and content of a zone file.
-rpz.phishing.local: This is the zone name as defined in your BIND configuration (e.g., in named.conf or named.conf.local).
-/etc/bind/rpz.phishing.db: Path to the zone file to validate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Schedule the Script with Cron
To automate the process, you can schedule this script to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly) using cron.

Edit the crontab for root (or a user with appropriate permissions to reload BIND):
#bash
sudo crontab -e


Add the following line to run the script daily at 2am:
#javascript
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh


This cron job will:

Run the script at 2:00 AM every day.
Update the RPZ files and reload BIND.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Testing the Script
After setting up the cron job, you can manually run the script once to ensure that it works as expected:

#bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/update-rpz.sh

Check the following after running the script:
-The RPZ zone files (rpz.malware.db and rpz.phishing.db) are updated with the domains from the feeds.
-BIND is reloaded, and there are no errors.
-Check /var/log/rpz-update.log for the script's log.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Monitoring and Debugging
If there are any issues with the cron job, you can check the system logs or the scriptâ€™s log file (/var/log/rpz-update.log) for debugging.
You can manually check the RPZ zone files by running dig on a known blocked domain to ensure that the zones are being applied correctly.
Example of checking a blocked domain:
#bash
dig @localhost bad-malware.com
The response should indicate that the domain is blocked (NXDOMAIN or a redirect, depending on your RPZ configuration)
